class Context:
    """Stores injection-process wide information.

    In some ways this is a wrapper for the preset that derives some
    information that is specifically important to the injection.

    The information in the context does not change during the injection.

    One Context exists for each injection process, which is shared
    with all coroutines and used objects.

    Benefits of the context:
    - less redundant passing around of parameters
    - easier to add new process wide information without having to adjust
      all function calls in unittests
    - makes the injection class shorter and more specific to a certain task,
      which is actually spinning up the injection.
